Guid to Clipboard
=================

Hey, this is a tiny Windows application I built way back in the ancient times (2014 or so) which, when clicked, will put a fresh GUID on your clipboard.

What for?

Mostly for development tasks that require frequent generation of GUIDs, such as content modeling in Optimizely CMS.

Usage
-----

1. Start the app. A little face icon will appear in your windows tray.

2. Click the face icon. You know have a fresh GUID on your clipboard.

3. You can also press `Windows Key` + `Shift` + `Z`.

Disclaimer
----------

I have not touched this code in quite some time. I'm not even sure it still compiles. This is a WinForms application, but still runs so I have no plans to update it.

Use at your own risk.
